I am a new driver! My driving experience has given me some interesting illustrations. This time it was the rear view mirror. A rear view mirror makes it possible for us to see what we have left behind us while our eyes are still on the road ahead. In one of my first driving lessons my driving instructor told me that most of the accidents (I don’t recall the exact figures he used) on the road can be avoided if you regularly look at the rear view mirrors. The last days of the year is similar to a rear view experience. We look back and recall the life changing events that occurred in the year that is about to leave us, while we are still looking forward to the year ahead of us.

It is important for us to look at the rear view mirror of our lives and identify the various ways in which God has been faithful to us. It might have been a rough year for most of us. Some of us might have lost our dear ones. Some of us might have been though a serious illness. Some of us might have been challenged financially. But if you see carefully, you will see God’s hand at work. Through the highs and lows of our lives He has been there beside us. Has God not been faithful to us? Recalling His faithfulness in the past helps us in trusting Him with our future. Let’s look ahead to the year before us reminding ourselves about how amazingly He has led us this far. So buckle up fellas, it is going to be another amazing ride through His faithfulness.
