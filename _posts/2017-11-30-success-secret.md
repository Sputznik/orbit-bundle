The Lord was with Joseph and he was a successful man - Gen 39:2

When the brothers of Joseph sold him to the merchants for twenty pieces of silver. These merchants brought Joseph to Egypt to be sold as a slave for a higher value. He would have lost all hope, dreams, career and ambition. As a young man he would have had many desires in his heart just as we do. He lost everything that he held dear including his family.

After Joseph was sold, the Jewish boy started his life as a ‘slave boy’ in an unknown city with foreigners and a different language. Just imagine how he would have struggled to just survive.

In the ancient days of Egypt, actually till the 18th century, one could find a slave in the market for purchase based on the price tag. These slaves were purchased for their entire lifetime. During the auction, most of the slaves would required to literally stand naked to ensure that they had no leprosy or other diseases. People were careful in those days as these contagious diseases had no cure. So just before the slaves were purchased, they had to go through a thorough body check.

Joseph was one among them who stood in the slave market with some price tag on his body, stripped naked to ensure that he had no diseases. Imagine the shame and humiliation he had when he had to stand in those busy streets where all eyes were fixed on him.

He had nothing on him to bank upon. But still the Scriptures mention that he was successful. Why?

He had no job, food, bank balance, education, parents or friends. Not even proper clothes to wear. But he was successful because the Lord was with him. His worth was not based on surpassing worldly assets, rather his worth was Eternal as God was backing him up.

Our success does not depends on what we have or what we don’t have. But our success depends on whom we have. We have Christ.

Colossians 1:16, 17
For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him. And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist.

Notice, it doesn’t say few things but all things are held in Him. These things may include our job, career, wisdom, health, favor, etc. It literally means all things, including our universe where we live. I encourage you to seek Jesus who is the secret of success.
