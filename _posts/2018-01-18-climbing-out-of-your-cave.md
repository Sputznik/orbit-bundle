Do you ever feel overwhelmed by life? We all do from time to time! There are times when we too find ourselves in one of life’s cave experiences.  We think all of our help and strength is gone.  We feel alone, discouraged and deserted.  Ever been there?
&nbsp;
Well, the first thing we need to acknowledge in such situations is that such experiences in life are there with a purpose ie, the Lord uses the hardships of life to develop us.  God does not do this to break us rather He does it to build us up.  As hard as it may be to understand and bear, God uses the times of affliction, suffering and pain in our lives to train us to become more like His darling Son Jesus.
&nbsp;
Secondly, every cave experiences in life brings forth certain revelations in time. They will reveal our character and commitment to God. Take Job for example, in his sufferings; Satan might have said, “Let me squeeze him and I’ll get a lemon juice from him. I’ll prove that what he appears to be on the outside is all a show. So the devil squeezed Job, he didn’t get lemon juice but he got lemonade.
&nbsp;
Friends, Job didn’t get sour on the Lord; he just shouted in the devil’s face and got sweeter (Job 1:20-21). Nothing demonstrates our level of character and commitment to God than our continued obedience and faithful service, even when we are in one of the caves of life!
&nbsp;
Finally, caves make for hard living but they are not altogether bad! There are some refreshing discoveries to be made in the caves of life. Caves have the ability to focus our priorities. When we go into a cave experience, we soon learn what is important and what is trivial. The caves will tighten our focus onto that which is most important: -finding and doing the will of God.
&nbsp;
Friends, let me encourage you God will bring us to the place where we are alone with Him and shut off from the rest of the world.  We fear those times, but they often precede the times of God’s greatest blessings in our lives! You see, there are lessons that are learned in the dark that cannot be learned in the light.  There are truths that can only be understood by those who are cut off and shut up with the Lord. In reality, the cave times can be a blessed time of instruction and growth for our lives. What about you?  Are your cave experiences a blessing to your life, or are they burdens that seem too heavy to carry? Think about it!!!
