Living the Calling - <i>Being a PK</i>
Tears sting my eyes as I think about what happened this morning; but it had gone way out of limit today. Dad had screamed at me in front of a whole crowd just for applying a bit of gloss. He had never done it and now when he had, it hurt bad. A million questions were running a marathon in my head. The most prominent one being - "Why couldn't I be like them?" And now, when I write "them", no, I'm not referring to the world, no, I'm not talking about the peers; I'm talking about the present <em>Christian</em> generation.

I had another one of my sleepless nights that day, and I was as usual sitting with a notebook and pen, tears freely flowing thinking about the recent events. The pain was so heavy that it was hurting physically now. As my dam broke and a whimper escaped my lips, I felt someone speaking to me. I started writing not really knowing what it was. I was like that sixth grade kid writing down what was being dictated by the teacher, in this case, it was the spirit of the Lord.

The nation of Israel when led from bondage to a land promised to them generations ago, were led by a very humble and a dear friend of God, Moses. The ways in which God worked for them was completely exclusive and totally unique. This one was no different. It so happened that once as the Israelites fought a war, Aaron and Hur were asked to help Moses in keeping his hand risen towards the battlefield to make Israel win.

Dear PK reading this, the role in this play of life for you and me is somewhat similar. The mission field and the ministry bestowed upon you needs your support. Your father as he leads, needs you to keep his hands risen to ensure victory.

Paul suggests not eating meat if it causes your brother to fall in sin (as mentioned in 1 Corinthians). That's a lifestyle change mentioned keeping in mind the purpose, to not be a reason someone chose the path of eternal hell. Sometimes the changes we need to bring causes us troubles and conflicts our lifestyle we have grown accustomed to, sometimes it irritates me and puts me in a place where I snap hearing the mere mention of the word, "Don't".

However, the revelation you need to get today is to know that your calling is different. It is an honor to have people look upto you. It is a privilege to have been the chosen vessel because He found us faithful (words of Paul). As someone rightly said, it's always mind over matter. Many are called but few are chosen.

I want to encourage you today<b> , Live the Calling with an understanding of the purpose behind it. </b>
<b><i>Be a blessing , Be a support , Change the thinking , Lead the kingdom - You are a PK ! </i></b>
