I feel, more often we think like Peter in the mount of transfiguration. After seeing Jesus transfigured, Peter felt the need to do some work, like, building tents. Really?

I understand we all have zeal for God, we want to partner in establishing His kingdom. We want to be of some use in the society. But is this what we are called for? In the mountain, while Peter was still babbling about building tents, Father God speaks up. He asks Peter to  listen to Jesus. <em>(Matthew 17)</em>

There are two types of listeners, one who listen to listen while others who listen to speak like Peter. Why are we listening to God? If we are listening to Jesus with an intention of listening, I'm sure He can speak affirmations over us in our struggles. For He says in John 16:33, <em>"I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world."</em>

We serve a God who wants us to take delight in trusting him. Romans 11:16,17 says, <em>"If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches. But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree."</em> This verse clearly shows us our existential reality. We are the branches, Christ is the root, that is, He is the source. And the beautiful nature of our God is that He partners with us. <strong>But this is not a partnership where we have to work, but instead we have to believe that it's Him and not us.</strong>

Even to believe in Christ is not initiated by us, but that too is the work which He does. As it is written in Hebrews that <strong>Jesus is the author and perfecter of our faith</strong>.  I'm not here to say, <em>"don't work for His Kingdom."</em> Because Bible clearly says in James 2:17, <em>"so also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead."</em> But be reminded of this, that, whatever happens through you is initiated by Him, and so will be completed by Him. <strong>Rest on Daddy, and be affirmed of the how much He loves you!</strong>
