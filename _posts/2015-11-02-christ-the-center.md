So many times you hear people say “God is first, family second, ministry third” or for some ministry second and family third. But I wonder if we can really form a hierarchy? Isn’t God the first, the second, the third, well isn’t God the center of it all? God is the only being in existence, the reason for whose existence lies within himself said Dr. Ravi Zacharias. All other beings seek for the reason for their existence outside themselves. The very reason of our existence is in God. Everything originates from him. He said “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.”

Forming a hierarchy can trap us in to not taking decision in view of God in these other areas of our life. Colossians 1:18 says “And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy.” In everything he might have the supremacy. He is first in EVERYTHING. So rather than putting God in a pecking order, I feel we should think of him as an axis around which everything revolves.

Jesus said “Because I live, you also will live.” Isn’t it amazing; the assurance that we have in Christ. I found the reason of my existence in Christ and I love him with all my heart, but at times some good sounding statements that people say can steal away the joy that is in Christ. We should weigh everything in the light of God’s word and shouldn’t be afraid to reason these matters. Isaiah 1:18 says “Come now, and let us reason together.”
