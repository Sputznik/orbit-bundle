Sitting on the sofa immersed in another one of Daddy daughter talks, I was amazed by the facts flowing freely from him even after being a Pastor. Concluding the conversation with a sense of pride on being my Daddy's girl I started scrolling my Facebook feed. I came across some posts mocking Pastors and prophets blaming them for taking tithe. Somebody had also put in efforts to write few lines on why pastors are not what they are supposed to be. Few lines of biblical definitions of prosperity and consecutively naming pastors as money mongers. Oh! The irony. Considering what we were just talking about. Unsurprisingly, it pained me to the core and hurt me deeply. Those posts were also an eye opener. Prettily judging the whole community of Pastors because of the experiences with a few.

Without further adieu, let me tell you a story.

Once upon a time, long ago in the journey of Israelites under the leadership of the young and suave gentleman named Joshua, there came a time when the priests were to cross the mighty river named Jordan. A river with a wave so strong and the rippling current. The Lord that led them through the Red Sea also ordained this walk.

The most prominent thing was the way every miracle happened amongst them. There was a law to be followed for a blessing to be received. There was a sanctification for a journey. Everything had its own regulations.

Consecutively, Joshua ordered a sanctification over the people irrespective of their age and gender ; thus marking the beginning of a historical journey. In compliance to the voice of Lord to Joshua, the priests were ordered to cross the river Jordan. Behind the priests carrying the ark of covenant were people following according to the tribe. Completely uniform in nature.

As soon as the priests stepped their foot on the brink of the river, the Lord, the Lord of heavens and the earth made the river stand in a heap. Soon following behind the priests were the people categorized according to their tribes. The hours passed and the priests reached the middle of the river and stood still to the side paving way for the crowd to move. Seconds turned to minutes, minutes turned to hours and hours to the time of the day. The people of the twelve tribes crossed the river and reached the dry land, all along when the priests carrying the ark were standing firm to the land. It was now the time of dark, the night. People had put up their tents in the dry land. Some had already retired for the night. Even amongst them there were some tents with their lamps still burning. The lamps burning outside of the tents of the family of priests. Children awaiting their Daddy's return, wives looking longingly at the door of the tent with ears sharpened to hear at least the footsteps of their beloveds. The family kept the lamp burning. And the lamp of prayer and hope shined in the blanket of darkness that covered the clouds.

My dear friend, you see, right from sanctification, leading the way to standing on the side paving the way to the congregation and the lamp burning in the household shows the power of prayer and the whole journey of a priest. Keeping the congregation above his own family often times, the man stands faithful in his ministry.

The pastor you just trolled, the pastor you just dedicated a meme to, the pastor whose sermon you mocked after a Sunday service, the Pastor you Love, the Pastor who irritates you to no end, the Pastor you just spoke against to, the Pastor you adore : He DESERVES your respect.

Romans 13:1 says, <em>"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God." </em>

1 Corinthians 12:28-31 says, <em>"And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way." </em>

1 Timothy 1:12 says, <em>'....he counted me faithful.'</em>

Dear church, just like every single human being is different, every other minister of God is different. If one a prophet, the other an apostle. If one a healer, the other a prayer warrior. Whithersoever, each one perseveres in being the best at who they are.

As humans, often times there will be conflict of thoughts and emotions but Mathew says, Do not be judged so that you don't get judged. Someone bound by just a single pump of the heart, we are all but just a mere breath.
Theology and humanly logic will tell you, the Levi priests are not the present day pastors. Let me remind you sweetheart, putting it in simpler words, if you see someone who stood with the Bible, don't even dare to go and dance on their head top. Bible or any other law doesn't give you that right or authority. Come on, the bear was quick to eat up the kids who called Elisha, a baldie. Got the intensity of raising your voice against Pastors? Good hun! Don't repeat the stupidity.

Someone once said, If you don't see the book you want to read on the shelf, write it. In the same manner, if you aren't pleased with your ministers in charge, take the reins. Get up, girdle up and prepare yourself. If God could able a Joshua after Moses, an Elisha after an Elijah, a Nehemiah after Ezra ; God can surely raise you too.

Have faith! Give respect! Run your race.
This is a PK's Cry!
