<em>"Hey. What's up dear? Long Time. No news" </em>

A text from one of my old school friends gave me a feeling of surprise and happiness altogether. The first thought that came to my mind, even before I decided on what to reply was, <em>"Does she still remember me?"</em>

Yeah!! It gives us so much joy when we come to know that we are in someone else's thoughts. Pause. Most of the times, itâ€™s not just the person you remember but is followed by a thread of memories associated with the person. None of us want to be forgotten by our beloved ones. Neither we want to forget people who mean a lot to us. But to forget is human tendency. We expect people to remember us especially when we need them the most. Unfortunately,we might not get a positive reaction from them always and can break us along with our hopes.

There's a story in Genesis of a woman named Rachel. She was beautiful and had a lovely figure. Jacob waited 14 years to marry Rachel.

<em>"but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her."</em> - Gen 29:19.

<em>"and his love for Rachel was greater than his love for Leah."</em> - Gen 29:30

These verses prove that Jacob loved Rachel very much. But she was barren. This made Rachel jealous of her sister who was having children. But as a woman, I can assume that she was more sad than being jealous. She could feel the loneliness when Jacob was not around. She was tormented from the taunts of her own sister. All these times, Rachel expected Jacob to comfort her but instead he got angry with her. Now, this was the time Rachel needed him the most but Jacob forgot to comfort her.

<em>"Then God remembered Rachel"</em> - Gen 30:22.
Yes. God did not count her past of being jealous to her sister. Instead He counted her silent tears which no one else could see. As a result He just did not give comfort but He also took away her disgrace. Joseph was born to her and because of him we remember Rachel today. When God remembers you, He makes the world remember you. Let God remember you because when He remembers you, He remembers your Disgrace also.
