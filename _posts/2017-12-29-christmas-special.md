Be it up in the North or down here in a small town of Karnataka, I hear the carol sing, "Go tell it on the mountains over the hills and everywhere, that Jesus Christ is born."
&nbsp;
It's Christmas night of 2017 and I am relishing on this tasty mutton pieces parceled to my room. I take my diary to think again why a lot of people have invited Christ in their lives. The answer was simple, He is the joy to their world (Christmas feels intended). 
&nbsp;
But, out of the black, not blue, because the skies have turned starry now with the thin curve of the moon trying to peak into my room. I gaze back at it and think of love (old Bollywood track playing in the background).
&nbsp;
<strong>Love is always about giving, it's sacrificial in nature.</strong>
&nbsp;
You may ask, <em>"is wanting love wrong?"</em>
&nbsp;
No, it is not, but wanting love can never achieve the love of the other. It feels obvious and loses its essence with time. There is no pleasure in anything that is asked and taken. Imagine yourself, always wanting to be heard, felt, experienced and you have to tell it to your partner so he or she understands what your need is. Constant effort of asking in itself can get frustrating with time and you hear the lines, "Don't you know.. I told you the last time too I want you to do <em>xyz</em> for me". The first dis-balance is felt when one says, "you haven't been <em>abc</em> to me". 
&nbsp;
Rings a bell? It's fine. Take a deep breath because Christ has the answer.
&nbsp;
It feels forceful sometimes to do what the other wants but when two people give in to their relationships, it somehow feels complete deep within.
&nbsp;
So it has to be won by giving. 
&nbsp;
When one gives, he or she immediately wins the other persons love.
I heard a couple at a wedding, the wife says, <em>"Love, you look handsome today"</em>, yes! the wife tells it first and the husband taken by surprise says, <em>"You have always looked beautiful, hon"</em> *smiles*. 
&nbsp;
It's like a chain reaction. 
&nbsp;
The only thing that changes the game is being the first one to break the ice. It gets so difficult for us to be the first ones to give because we think we haven't got it from the other side yet! 
&nbsp;
The Bible says, God so loved the world that when He saw man caught in darkness He came down to reach out to His Love fill their life with light.
&nbsp;
So He took the first step in this relationship,
And the best of it all is, He came to 
'for-give' our unruly and evil deeds .
&nbsp;
He gave Himself for our sake. He taught us what unconditional love can mean. He has always been the initiator. 
&nbsp;
It is Christ because He is 'for-ever giving'. His love never runs out. Christ is love. 
&nbsp;
The birth of Christ, I realized can never be a one day celebration, it is a love affair that lasts for eternity.
