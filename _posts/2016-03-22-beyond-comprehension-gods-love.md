God loves you, it’s not like what the world gives.

I am talking to you about God’s amazing love. A relationship with God is like no other relationship you may have experienced.

Yes, there is nothing like the love of God! It is the most overwhelming thing I have ever encountered in my life.

<em>God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us</em> <em>(Romans 5:7)</em>. Demonstrates means to show, prove, establish, or render conspicuous.

God’s gracious love took the initiative to save us from our helpless, ungodly condition.

These verses show that salvation is totally from God and His great love. There was nothing in us that was lovable or that motivated God to send the Saviour. As God pictures Israel <em>(Ezekiel 16:3-6, 9-10)</em>, we were like an unwanted new-born infant, thrown into a field, squirming in our blood, a piece of garbage about to die. He took us, bathed us with water, anointed us with oil, and wrapped us in fine garments. Salvation stems from His great love.

Amazing, isn't it? God knows me and still loves me. God knows that I am a sinner, yet He forgives; I am diseased, yet He heals; I am in a pit, yet He pulls me out; I am ungrateful for His good gifts, yet He gives them anyway; and I deserve justice, yet He grants mercy.

God’s amazing love is not based on us getting our act together to deserve it. It is not based on our track record of performance to guarantee its continued flow. Rather, God’s love is based on the fact that God is love <em>(1 John 4:7)</em>. He is gracious <em>(Exodus 34:6)</em>. He extends His love and grace to sinners apart from and in spite of anything in them.

Like a father's love for a wayward and rebellious son that waits anxiously for him to return home so he can grant him a new start, is God's love for us. It is beyond comprehension.

God says, <em>“I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with loving kindness”</em> <em>(Jeremiah 31:3)</em>.

The knowledge that God loves you will keep you going when things go wrong. Bible says <em>“For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”</em> <em>(Romans 8:38, 39)</em>

Volumes have been written about the characteristics of God, but when it is distilled to the most basic categories, He is love <em>(1 John 4:8).</em> Love is not something he chooses to do or give. It is the very essence of who He is. He doesn't just love-He is love.
