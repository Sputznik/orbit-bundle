Israelites - God’s chosen generation. No doubt, God’s hand was upon the Israelites. He cared for them. Do you also think he cares less for you and me? Is Lord not willing to stretch out His caring hand upon us? The very normal struggle we all face at some point in our lives.

Now Israelites have been praying to God for their deliverance, the very expression of Israelites’ faith in the Lord. Isn’t it good when we all pray and expect with hope from the Lord?

Compassionate Lord heard their cry and result was Moses being appointed as their leader - escorting them to their Promised Land. All the incidents during this exodus made history - parting of the Red Sea, water from the rock and the pillars of fire and cloud.

Does this make you feel God loved them more? Because things are happening in somebody’s life and not in yours, God plays favoritism? Because this has been my struggle too, I want you to refer, Romans 2:11, which says, <em>“For God does not show favoritism”</em> (NLT).

This verse brought me peace and satisfaction, along with surety that the Lord’s grace is for everybody who hopes and trusts in Him. And he does not care less for me than for anyone else.

Witnessing all the miracles done by Lord, Israelites reached their Promised Land - Canaan, I mean those who were faithfully holding on. For you and I, the toughest generation to deal with, it is inscribed in Psalms 138:8, <em>"the Lord will fulfill His purpose for me."</em>

Israelites yet doubted their future, rather doubted their Lord, who bought them out of Egypt’s slavery. This time they nurtured their doubt right in the Promised Land. Land: that was promised by the Lord. Place where the promise was fulfilled.

Believing Psalms 138:8 is actually not going to be constant and we do hit rough roads. Thankfully we are not alone and <em>"The Lord is our helper; we will not be afraid."</em> says Hebrews 13:6. What’s that one thing making your focus blurred? Truly convicted by the Spirit, I could hear that whisper, <em>"Sitting in your promised land and doubting your future with me?"</em>

Faith and doubt cannot co-exist but as my friend told Faith with questions can surely be companions. Down in the journey questions will leave and Spirit would lead where trust is beyond waters!
