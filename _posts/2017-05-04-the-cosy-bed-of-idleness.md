<h4 id="1b8f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Idle-atry</h4>
The art of sitting idle and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">waiting upon the Lord</em>.

And we have wonderful Bible verses to support the idea.

<blockquote>Be still and know that I am God.</blockquote>

and,

<blockquote>Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord.</blockquote>

But the only strength that in rising is our strength of tearing away those chicken wings or of gorging on all those sweet desserts. Only muscles that are growing is the belly fat. Only muscles that are flexing is either the cheek muscles due to overeating and/or grumbling, or those which occasionally come to motion while stretching after that long sleep marathon.

<em>But is this what God really wants from our lives?</em>
<em>Is this really what we are made for?</em>

Because those some of the magic spells we invoke when asked (read <em>taunted/confronted</em>) about our laziness and slumber.

We are trying so hard to grasp what God has in store for us in the future and not really trying to accomplish all that God has in store for us right now. We are so much interested to peep into the future and not at all interested to really look at the present and embrace it for what it is.

There is a very clear line between really waiting upon the Lord and waiting on and on and on for God to really kick you out of that bed of yours.

Letâ€™s get to work!
