Ever paused after taking a bite from your favourite dish? Does it go down straight to your tummy or do you let it do a ballet on your tongue and enjoy?

Life these days has become a <em>busy-ness</em>. It has become all about the hurry-ness which results in worry and then somewhere along the line if you look back you’ll definitely feel sorry because you dint pause to enjoy the moments.

<strong><em> The Here Now Moment.
</em></strong>
That smile from a stranger, That kiss from a spouse, That hug from a parent, Those words that you sing in the church, That Grace from the heavens which actually holds us together, are we beholding it with wonder or are we completely missing out on it because we are in a busy-ness?

Busyness and Anxiety robs our joy. If only, we can "pause" and take in every moment of this life with "gratitude", we would create our days and years of pure joy. Who knows what tomorrow holds or what next minute holds. But this moment matters.
<strong>This moment, I will Pause.
This moment, I will wonder.
This moment , I will Praise. </strong>

Every living thing doesn’t have to look too far to find reasons to praise, only if it chooses to look for it.
Our lives would look different each day if our eyes are filled with wonder and our hearts filled with gratitude.

Wonder at the skies, if only you take time to look up.
Wonder at the very breath that you take, if only you realise that you are alive!
Wonder at the flowers you see and the fruits you eat.
Wonder at the sound birds make.
Wonder how your heart beats.
Wonder at the beauty of rain.
Wonder at the water.
Wonder at the sunset skies.
Everything that we see is a beautiful reflection of a God who has breathed it all so our hearts will long to behold the Eternally Beautiful One.. May be if we pause, wonder and praise, our hearts will begin to gaze upon the beauty of our God.

<strong>Wonder, Wonder</strong>!

Lost your wonder in life? Come back to the heart of a little child. Wonder at the smile of your mother, wonder at the laugh of your father. If you ask how do you wonder at something that's tough? Look up, pause from disappointments and come back to the heart of a little child beholding the love of A Heavenly Father who thinks of you every second and smiles at you with love. <strong>Wide-eyed Wonder.</strong>

<strong><em>Pause, Wonder, Praise</em>.</strong> If these could be our filters to how we take life every minute, there would be moments of joy and praise, even in the toughest seasons!
