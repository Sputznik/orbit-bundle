I know that most of us believe that we are God’s children. If we are His children then why do we live in fear? Why are we fearful of being influenced by the world? Shouldn’t it be the other way round?

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t we have God’s grace that is superabundant over sin? Or Christ’s blessings that overrides any curse? Or God’s light that can breakthrough thick darkness?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If this is all true, then why do we act defenseless? </span>

<b><i>Romans 8:19-21</i></b>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God.</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We as children of God, bring freedom in this decaying world. Chosen to be a beacon of hope in the hopelessness that is around us. Hence, infecting His grace in the atmosphere. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Call me naive but I really believe that we are the changing agents of our surroundings. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When Paul was writing </span><b><i>Romans</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he was writing to a bunch of Christians who were going through extreme persecution. And he repeatedly reminds them to think beyond their present circumstances, to realise what it means to be a child of God. Our circumstances cannot be compared to the hope of our calling </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Romans 8:18-19)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My friends, can we look beyond our circumstances? Can we be fearless of being infected by the world? We are called to be infectious, bringing heaven down on earth. Can we start acting on our right of being God’s children?</span>
