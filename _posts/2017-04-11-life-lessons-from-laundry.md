“My washing machine has given up on me.”, my mother texted me. Another few texts came flooding in, “I just put in a load and it's just refusing to wash.” Immediately, I shared the mighty words of wisdom that our generation lives by and insisted, “Try restarting it!”. That’s always the solution, isn’t it? Well, apparently not. “I’ve already tried that several times but it’s just not working”, she sent back.

We tried everything but all the washing machine did was beep. Just when I suggested she call the company technicians to come and have a look at it my phone buzzed with another text that read, “I fixed it!”

Now, we all know how tech-savvy parents are becoming so you’re probably not alarmed to hear that she googled it. Clever as she is, she figured out what the problem was and fixed it.

The washing machine, that deceivingly looks brand new is, in fact, 17 years old. Unfortunately, age is catching up and a magnet broke off it. Mama found the magnet, fixed it into its right place and secured it with scotch tape. And <em>Voila, </em>it’s good as new again.

The magnet is this itsy-bitsy thing that you’d barely believe served a purpose at all. A diameter of barely an inch and covered in rust, yet it was indispensable. That’s when we realized that God always does that.

We tend to throw broken things away, but Father <em>specializes in exalting the insignificant.</em> He picks those the world calls unworthy and transforms them to being worthy. Of course, He doesn’t <em>need</em> us, yet <em>He delights in using the broken to bring to nothing things which are mighty. </em>

‘Jesus didn’t call the equipped, He equipped the called.’ We’ve heard it one too many times but are we really listening? In God, we find our significance and purpose.

And so, despite our long list of limitations and even our grumpy outbursts Father delights in using us to bring down giants. So, trust me on this, you are worthy. You are worthy of a purpose that goes far beyond your estimated ability. You may be rusty but you’ve still got in you.

<em>“Each time he said, “My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.” So now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ can work through me. That’s why I take pleasure in my weaknesses, and in the insults, hardships, persecutions, and troubles that I suffer for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong.” -2 Corinthians 12:9</em>
