It’s been two months since I last wrote, and much as I’d like to say it’s because I’m on my honeymoon, that wouldn’t be entirely true. I’ve been unwell for two months now. I had five visits to the hospital last month! No, I’m not pregnant (I know you were wondering). And, I won’t get into details to stick to my word limit, but it was rough. I speak for myself when I say that always feeling sick is the easiest way to feel down.

In the midst of it all, I was reminded that God is good. I know some of us cringe at that thought. Of course, I don’t know what you’ve been through. Of course, I wouldn’t understand. Trust me, I get that. But we can’t correlate His goodness with the state of our lives. I’m not suggesting that <em>all </em>things that happen to us are good. Losing a loved one is never good. Being betrayed by someone isn’t good either. Bad things do happen to us, and often, they’re not blessings in disguise. But, unlike social media, Jesus doesn’t ask us to pretend like pain isn’t real.

What I am saying, is that His love does more than feel sorry for us. God’s goodness helps us, and His love heals us from our pain. God is constant, and He is constantly good. Whether we agree or not, He is good. Irrespective of our opinions and situations, He is good. And especially when life is rough, I’m so grateful that He is.

<em>“So why would I fear the future? For your goodness and love pursue me all the days of my life.” -Psalm 23:6</em>

I’m encouraged by David’s confidence when he says that. Another translation reads, “<em>Surely</em> goodness and mercy will follow me <em>all</em> the days of my life”. I love how he makes it sound silly to doubt it. Of course, God’s goodness is going to hunt me down and pursue me <em>all </em>the days of my life. Even on Mondays! Would you believe that?

On rough days, I choose to trust that the Creator knows what He is doing, and then, rest in the assurance that His goodness and love is pursuing me. Some days I’ll be able to see it even with my eyes shut and on other days I may need to look a little closer; but it’s right there, every day of my life. His goodness is pursuing us every moment and there is nothing that can stop Him. And on the days that I don’t believe it, His reckless love will pursue me anyway!

<em>“So, we are convinced that every detail of our lives is continually woven together to fit into God’s perfect plan of bringing good into our lives.” -Romans 8:28</em>
