I was suffocating in my old job and was praying to God for a breakthrough with my husband who was going through the same. We were praying earnestly to God for opening a way to move out. Nothing happened for a year. We remained stuck to where we were and could not see anything in the real world but God was working behind the scenes. And then one day God opened a door of opportunity for my husband to work abroad. We were a bit apprehensive but mostly excited and then we just walked in faith and accepted the offer. I had to quit my job to join my husband. There were a lot of uncertainties.

There are still a lot many uncertainties but step by step God kept leading us so beautifully, we had to get our visa extended and it was taking forever. We were losing our patience and getting desperate, really desperate. We were waiting because we had to, but our attitude during the waiting period was terrible. We were cribbing, being bitter, questioning God and what not, we even tried fasting not to humble ourselves but to be in self-pity and hoping to twist God’s arm. I feel ashamed of my attitude then. But God remained faithful and did not judge us for how we behaved and was still merciful. In a beautiful and the most amazing way our visa got renewed in God’s beautiful time. Then as soon as that was done we applied for my work permit and this time again we had to wait, but we had learnt from our past mistakes and decided to have a good attitude while trusting God.

In the meanwhile I applied for a job and had to undergo at least 5 rounds of interviews over a period of 2 months and God graciously carried me through each of those interviews and I got the job and soon after that within a few days I got my work permit and in a week’s time I started working and by God’s grace it’s close to a month now that I have started working.

As I look back, all I can see is God’s amazing grace, in spite of my bad attitude. Believe me God’s time is the best time and if God is not doing it your way, He’s doing it his way and His ways are far greater and far better than our ways. He knows the end from the beginning and His plans are always full proof. He will never let you go, He will never leave you nor forsake you, He will never put you to shame.

Now we have other stuff that is going on and we are waiting on God. It sometimes gets frustrating when we have to wait, but the best part is we can always look on God’s amazing goodness in the past. He is the same unchanging God who has carried us through thus far is faithful to carry us through till the end.
