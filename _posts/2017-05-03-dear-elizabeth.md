Dear Elizabeth,

I'm sorry that I took so long to respond to your mail. Anyways, I think today is the perfect day to write. I have some exciting news to share.

Last week, my brother Lazarus fell ill. We tried everything and he was just getting worse. And eventually, he died. We had his funeral too. This was 3 days ago. You must be wondering what the good news is.

Well, Jesus arrived this morning. When Lazarus got sick earlier, we had asked of him because we saw God working through him. When I saw him today, I had wished he had come earlier. The moment I heard about his arrival, I went out to meet him. Seeing him, I just poured my heart out to him, saying, <em>"Lord, only if you had been here, this would not have happened. But even now, I believe that God works in and through you."</em> Looking back at that statement now, I realize that the people around me who heard me might have thought that I was still expecting a miracle. But, to be honest, I had no clue then that something more could happen. I was just confessing what I generally believed about Jesus. But on hearing that, Jesus replied, <em>"Your brother will live again."</em> I was like, of course on the last day, at the resurrection. That's when he said, <em>"No, Martha, not on the last day. I'm talking about right now. I'm the resurrection and the life. Do you believe?"</em> At this point, I really didn't know what to say. I couldn't think it was even a possibility to see my brother again. How could I? I saw him die. There was no light in his eyes. I buried him. How could he just come back to life? So, I just wrapped the conversation up, saying, <em>"Yes you are Christ, the Son of God."</em>

Elizabeth, now what I am about to tell you might shock you, but this has turned my entire life around. Just before noon, we took Jesus to where Lazarusâ€™ body was laid. By now, there was a foul stench around the cave. He asked us to remove the stone from the cave. He prayed a small prayer and called out to Lazarus. My head was spinning around by this time. I was a little embarrassed when he did that. The entire neighborhood was there. But every confusion, sorrow and unbelief vanished the moment I saw my brother walk out of that grave. The joy that took over me! Yes, Elizabeth, you read right. My brother was dead and is alive again! Jesus is the resurrection and life. He wasn't talking about the last day of resurrection. He really meant it, that today I would see my brother alive.

I can't tell you how happy I am. I have been yapping to everybody I meet. I'm so overjoyed and overwhelmed at the same time! I feel before today, I didn't really believe that Jesus is the Son of God, but now I do.

He is in town for a week. I was wondering if you wanted to meet him. One encounter with him can change your life. I believe he is really the one we have been praying for, the Messiah. So excited for what God has planned!

Anyway, let's meet up soon. Let me know if you are coming over.

Love,
Martha
