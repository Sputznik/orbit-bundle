I was born as a Pastor's kid. Some call it a ‘privilege’; some call it a ‘pain’. I call it a ’PURPOSE’. I believe there is a reason why we're born into a particular family.  If I were asked this question a few years ago, I would have called it a ‘Pain’ as well.

As fancy as it seems, being a PK (Pastor's Kid) is not easy. There are those who look up to you and think you would never do wrong, while there are others who wait for you to fall. I grew up frustrated trying to be the "good girl" I was expected to be. I was forced to feel emotions I didn't want to, I had to put a smile on my face although I was crying inside, and I had to pretend everything was perfect to satisfy the image of being a ‘PK’. I was torn between the image I had to portray for society and the person I truly wanted to be.

I am a human being, I make mistakes, I fall, I break down just as any other girl my age would. But then why was it that a PK had higher repercussions than the others?  Why were others not judged the way I was, for being just like everyone else?

I was blessed to be raised by parents who loved me for who I am and treated me like a regular child but somewhere deep inside I knew that if I slipped, my parents would be blamed. We live in a society where "public image" holds great value, which in turn causes bias expectations. And expectations inevitably brew judgment. Even as it is written "Thou shall not judge"; at the end of the day we are all human beings living in a judgmental society. Matthew 7:12 says, “So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you”.

Why is it so easy for us to expect from others what we do not practice ourselves? Why is it that we rarely take the time to understand the reasons behind a person's behavior? Or perhaps take the time to completely comprehend their story?

It's easy to point the finger at another person's flaws, while equally difficult to find those flaws in you. Putting somebody up on a pedestal will always lead to disappointment. Remind yourself that before being a leader or a role model, they are only human. Humans Disappoint, God Doesn't. Give God his rightful place in your heart.

As I grew older and grew tired of my rebellious nature I realized the "Purpose" God stored for me.  What I once considered a pain had now turned into a feeling of responsibility. I was born to parents that had committed their life to love and serve the community. My purpose was not to be 'just a Pastor's Kid', it was a responsibility to love and accept people without finding fault.

Romans 8:28 "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose". Today, I have no fear or shame in admitting my past. God turned the condition of my heart into a beautiful learning experience; an experience that has contributed to my way of perceiving people around me.

So, the next time you come across a PK, give them a hug, and bless them with some encouragement. What do you have to lose? Be a genuine friend, you may not know of the battle they might be facing behind that smile. They need encouragement more than you can imagine! Do not underestimate the POWER of your encouragement.

And to all my PK friends or anyone in a similar situation, remember that God understands your heart and he NEVER ever DISAPPOINTS.
