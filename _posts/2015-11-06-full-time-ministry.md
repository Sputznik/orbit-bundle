Have you ever thought to yourself that you want to work at a church or a Christian organization because you have been touched by God’s love and are convicted to serve? That’s awesome, but I have often found people directly relating ministry to working at a church or a Christian organization.

The term they use is “<strong>full time ministry</strong>.” We have the tendency to wrongly use statements and mystify the meaning, sometimes even alter it. Could this phrase have altered the meaning of ministry?

Greek word for ministry is diakoneo which means “to be a servant.” When you understand the gospel of Christ, it brings a lot of changes in you. One of the things that it does to you is that it makes you a servant. Jesus said “You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and rightly so, for that is what I am.<strong><sup> </sup></strong>Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet. <strong><sup> </sup></strong>I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you” (John13:13-15.) We all become servants and yes full time servants regardless of where we work.

Would you disagree if I say “you can work at a church yet not be a minister, and not work in a church but still be a minister.” The point I want to raise is, thinking that ministry happens only in Church can lead us to not be a minister in other places which is not what Christ desires. Christ became a servant and we are to follow him wherever we are.

“Even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” (Matthew 20:28)
