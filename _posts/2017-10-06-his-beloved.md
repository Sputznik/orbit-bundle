<blockquote>I am my lover’s and my lover is mine - Solomon 6:3</blockquote>
When you think of religion, what comes to your mind—A set of rules, regulations and obligations or a deep, intimate relationship with God? Throughout our life, we have been taught to become a goal oriented person. How emancipating it is to realize that we couldn’t be good enough for him to love us more, or bad enough for him to love us less!

We need to learn that Jesus freely lovingly accepts us and fills us up with his ludicrously lavish love. Instead of being bound to a list of do’s and don'ts,we must began to serve God out of gratitude for all he accomplished on the cross. Christ has a tender care and special attention to our needs as if they were his own needs. Our Bridegroom, Jesus Christ died so we could have a living, vital relationship with God, not just a bunch of rules and regulations, we are forced to follow.

When we have a real relationship with God through Christ, life gets exciting because He stirs up a passion inside us to love people—and we don’t have to struggle to do the things He calls us to do. It just happens naturally. Living with Jesus Christ as your Lord is a relationship of love. The point to notice here is that the Lord has not only given us His gifts, but He has given us Himself.

We have His pardon <em>(Mark 2:5)</em>; His gift of eternal life <em>(Romans 6:23)</em>; His joy <em>(John 15:11)</em>; His peace <em>(John 14:27)</em>; and His love <em>(John 13:1)</em>; but above all, and best of all, we have <strong>Him</strong>.

<em>"I am my Lover’s and my Lover is mine!” </em>

The reason we are so confident of Christ’s love for us is because he loved us. Like an earthly bridegroom willingly and gladly assumes the responsibility for the safe keeping of his bride, so does our Heavenly Bridegroom guarantee our protection for time and for eternity. How blessed is this assurance.
