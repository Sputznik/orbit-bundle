<em>“Kehna asaan hai par karna mushkil”.</em>

“It is better said than done”. We hear this quite often when someone is trying to console or encourage us.
You might be thinking “What is wrong in that?”
No, there’s nothing wrong with this phrase. Infact it is the truth.

Well, think about it. How easy is it for us to forget about the people we’ve lost in our life and move on? Or how easy is it for us to think positive when we are actually surrounded with failures and disappointments? And how frustrating it is when all our loved ones during such circumstances say “everything will be alright just think positive”?

Nobody likes to be depressed or sad. No one wants to feel left alone or feel miserable going through failures. Everyone goes through this phase, some survive, some don’t and some victoriously triumph. I’m sure all of us want to be victors.

'Victory'
What is victory and how do we achieve it?

According to Wikipedia, it’s a word given to success achieved after personal combat or military operations in general. Victory is the positive result of a WAR.

Seriously, are we in a war?

Result of any war is a question of life and death. We are in this constant warfare of the mind whose result is indeed a question of life and death. Take for example depression. It affects a person’s behaviour, thoughts and actions to the point of him/her committing suicide.

Our mind keeps fighting every day. And we get caught up with the ongoing positive and negative debate of thoughts that we forget the most important necessity of our lives.

Are we fighting alone? Who can fight on our behalf?
Depression, failures and disappointments indeed makes us weak.

<strong>Romans 8:37</strong> – “But in all these things we win a sweeping victory through the one who loved us.”

We often forget that there is one person who loves us, with all His might and heart. Why?
Because He created us and we belong to Him. When I draw something, I keep it so safe and love it like anything no matter how many people ridicule it.

No matter how many people say that they don’t like us or don’t enjoy our company or that we are worthless. God still cares for us and loves us dearly.

So let’s remind ourselves that we are not fighting alone. He is fighting for us!

All we got to do is lose ourselves and give it all to HIM and know that He loves us more than anyone despite of all our weakness and mistakes.
Trust Him and hold on. He will give you the strength to withstand all the weapons of the devil.

<strong>Isaiah 41:10-13</strong> – “Don’t fear, because I am with you: don’t be afraid, <span style="color: #ff0000;">for I am your God. I will strengthen you</span>, I will surely help you; <span style="color: #ff0000;">I will hold you with my righteous strong hand</span>. All who rage against you will be shamed and disgraced. Those who contend with you will be as nothing and will perish. <span style="color: #ff0000;">You will look for your opponents, and won’t find them</span>. Those who fight you will be of no account and will die. I am <span style="color: #ff0000;">the Lord of God who grasps your strong</span> hand, who says to you, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Don’t fear; I will help you</span>.”

He is the only weapon we need. All we need is HIM <strong>“JESUS”</strong>.
