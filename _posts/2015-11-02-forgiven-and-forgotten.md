<strong>GOD HAS FORGIVEN &amp; FORGOTTEN OUR SINS THROUGH JESUS CHRIST</strong>

Psalm 90 "You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence."

According to this verse, we might feel that we are not worthy to go to His presence. When we go to Church, we think that God's light exposes our sins, thus making us feel guilty all the time. But friends! That was true only under the Old Covenant. Under the Old Covenant, the Ten Commandments told the people to obey. Whenever they failed they knew that God remembered their sins.

But I am here to tell you the good news of the gospel. The gospel that declares, the Ten Commandments and Laws have been fulfilled and taken away on the cross because by Jesus' death - by his one sacrifice - ALL our sins have been forgiven!!

The Old Covenant was all about man's deeds, and therefore man's sins were always before God. But the New Covenant is ALL ABOUT JESUS's obedience. Therefore God cannot and will never remember our sins anymore because the work of Jesus was so perfect enough to wipe out all our sins.

<strong>Isaiah 43 "I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins NO MORE"</strong>

God says "NO MORE!!!” Today, when we go to Church, God's marvelous light does not reveal how sinful we are, but how righteous we are in Christ!!
In fact, His light shines in you because of Jesus who lives in you. He is your light and you are no more in darkness.

Hebrews 10:17

…“Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.”

I don’t know about you, but I would say that <strong>Hebrews 10:17</strong> is good news. God sees all our sins-past, present and future-and says, “Your sins I remember no more!” The words “no more” are a strong double negative in the original Greek text. In other words, God is saying, “Your sins I will by <strong>no means ever </strong>remember!”

Has God lowered His standards? No, He is still perfectly holy. He did remember all our sins-2,000 years ago at the cross. Every sin which we have committed or will commit has been punished to the full in the body of Jesus Christ at the cross. That is why today, God remembers our sins no more. We should, therefore, not be sin-conscious.

Hebrews 10:12, 14 says, “But this Man [Jesus], after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God…For by one offering He has perfected forever…”

You and I are perfected forever because of Jesus’ perfect work on the cross. We are perfected by God’s full acceptance and perfect delight in His Son’s work that has so glorified His holiness. Beloved, hear God say to you, “I will be merciful. Your sins and lawless deeds I will remember no more.”

I love Romans 6.

I love the way Paul repeats over and over again that we have been set free from sin.

It happens in verse 7.

<em>“Anyone who has died has been set free from sin.”</em>

Then again in verse 18.

<em>“You have been set free from sin.”</em>

Then <em>again</em> in verse 22.

<em>“You have been set free from sin.”</em>

I think Paul was trying to tell us something!

And it doesn’t take a genius to work out <em>what</em> Paul was trying to tell us:

<em>You have been set free from sin! </em>

Each time we feel condemned for our past mistakes, God wants us to remember the cross and say, “Lord Jesus, you were sentenced for this sin I committed. You bore the judgment, so God will not judge me for this sin. You were condemned for this sin, so God will not condemn me for it.”

If you don’t look to the cross, you will become sin-conscious and you will walk around with a certain expectation of judgment. You must come to the place where you know and believe that all your sins are forgiven, and that you are saved eternally.

We are free.

Free from sin.

Absolutely, perfectly, completely free.

Amen!
