Living in the times where putting oneself out and show people that "I am something" consumes so much of our time on a daily bases, doing things which does signify very little to us but want to show the world that it means the world to us.

We boil down life and faith to so many questions, like "Can I get a tattoo?" "Is it OK to be inked?" "Is it okay to wear Ornaments?" "Is it okay to eat pork?" "My pastor says 'you can't do that' quoting bible"

I consider these very subjects to be one of the greatest or the worst way to get a person away from the God, let me help you break it down.

I feel God does work on people in that very period/season to help us understand things better.

In the days of Noah, after all the flood receding (Genesis 9:1-4).
(Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth. The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth, and on all the birds in the sky, on every creature that moves along the ground, and on all the fish in the sea; they are given into your hands.<strong> Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.</strong> “But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it.
Genesis 9:1‭-‬4 NIV)

I see it this way that God says this in the time of need and to that very season, where Noah needed to flourish and expand and God finds it important for Noah to eat without any restrictions.

If you read the introduction of Leviticus (reading from Topical study Bible N.L.T). It says chapter 19 is "similar laws as to the Ten Commandments" which means it is for people and debunks the notion of people saying "Leviticus is only for Levites and it's just for our information!"

Here in Leviticus, God was in the season of shaping Israel from that flock of nonsense they came out as from Egypt.
That's why we read Israel falls for gluttony and praising Egypt while they were in the wilderness but failed to see what God was doing to/for them day in and day out.

We move forward to New Testament, in Acts ch 10. The famous passage of Peter's vision of food. We should understand that God intentions for Peter was to be okay to be with the non-Jewish people.

To sum up all the premises, These questions sound really interesting but they are only there to get us away from God.

In fact, it is never a question of whether to get a tattoo or not, whether to eat something or not.

It's a personal choice. If you want to do it, it is up to you.

Bible says no matter what we do we can never be good enough for God to consider us based on our righteousness or actions, but we are saved ONLY by His grace through our faith.

Keeping in mind not to damage our body, not to ignore things thinking "whatever I do will not please God and he is always gracious so why should I be a certain way?"
<strong>God's grace will help us to push hard on living up to God's expectations.</strong>
