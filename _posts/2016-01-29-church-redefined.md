If I ask the question, <strong>'why do we go to church?'</strong>, most Christians would reply, <strong>"to worship"</strong>.

<strong>#1</strong> We worship the Lord through our lives when our life is the testimony of the Gospel <em>(Romans 12:1)</em>.

<strong>#2</strong> Why are we looking for a place to worship? Aren’t we are the place of worship?
Jesus said to the Samaritan woman that the time has come when we will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not go to places</span> of worship but will worship the Father in truth and spirit <em>(John 4:21-24)</em>.

The enemy has been successful in distorting the true picture of the Church. He has skewed our identity by making us believe that church is not us i.e. the body of Christ but a place of worship. Do we even understand how far we have been distracted from the truth?

We all are perhaps going to different places for fellowship but we are the parts of one body! Church is not a building or an organization but the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">body of Christ</span>.

<strong>We are the Church!</strong>

We have deviated from the truth by bringing so many divisions within ourselves. The enemy has succeeded to divide us even on the pretext of theology. You think he cares even if we are right? He just cares about the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">division</span>!

Within the body of Christ where is our charity? Why can't we be graceful to one another? Why can’t we accept each other regardless of our disagreements? Our greatest fault is in assuming that our assessment is right! Right according to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">'our perception'</span>!

Unfortunately we are all biased in our approach and worse, we don't realize that we are biased. We somehow end up believing that anything that is different from our point of view is against it, and then it becomes more about 'who' is right than 'what' is right. Somehow the focus is to be right than searching for the truth.
