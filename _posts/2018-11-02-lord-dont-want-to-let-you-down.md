What? Seriously! Like you really feel, you can ever let Him down? Okay, so do you also feel that He has set some limits which you should and have to come across to make Him PROUD over you?

Do you also feel in every appreciation you have to say it out Loud, “Glory be to God”? Or you would join me in feeling, you can never put out your opinion in a conversation and need to be submissive all the time (This is way different than being rude and putting your views across). Well, I have tried such and many more other things while wanting to earn, “Good and Obeying Christian” badge. The truth is when I strive more to earn this I was pushed to feel harder to love or even to like myself.

No offense! I have been there and I want to share this is the best trick to know that we all are in a constant desire of living a life that would shine for Jesus alone. The only thing, my ways were not right and needed some direction.

Amidst all the things I was trying to achieve or make happen in pursuit of making Him happy, I completely forgot about what He had already told me. In psalms 139: 15, It is clearly mentioned that Daddy knows us well <em>"You saw my bones being formed as I took shape in my mother’s body. When I was put together there, you saw my body as it was formed. All the days planned for me were written in your book before I was one day old."</em> Isn’t it amazing that our Lord already knows our deeper thoughts and we need not to show or impress Him with our mere actions. Being a loving Father, HE deeply desires our love- a relationship, which We (Lord and Us) would cherish always!

I slowly started understanding my genuine love for Daddy, which could never be seen by anyone but could only be felt by the Lord. Such relationships are enough to help us know that He is always smiling over us and are proud to be our daddy, ALWAYS :)

I pray, if any of you are hurting, offended and are fed up with the continuous striving, may you find the real rest and assurance in Him alone that no act from this whole wide world could make OUR DADDY love me and You more.

Also nothing You and I could do or have done that could make Him surprised or sad over US.
