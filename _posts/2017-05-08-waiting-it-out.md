On one hot afternoon, I lay beside mum to have some mother-daughter time. While we were shoe-shopping on her phone, a beautiful pair of golden slippers caught mum's eyes. My economical side blew up as she showed me the price. I just said, <em>"Don't take it. It's not a trusted brand. We don't know its quality."</em> She frowned while getting impatient. And even though it was heavily overpriced I succumbed only to see her smile.

Five days later the most -awaited- overpriced-pair-of-slippers-I-had-ever -seen arrived. I made the payment and waited anxiously for mum to arrive home from school. As soon as she came I brought in the package, still sealed. She begged for scissors and gently opened her prize.

Alas! Like I feared. It WAS overpriced. The quality was as good as a pair of 150 bucks (INR 150). Another reason why I seldom shop online. Although mum loved the pair online for its elegance, it looked the opposite in her hand.

She put the slippers back into the box and said, <em>"I think we should return it."</em>

I just grinned while enjoying a victorious laugh inside saying, <em>"I told you so!"</em>. Â But I knew she was sad. More so disappointed.

Do we get disappointed too, when we make decisions and the result isn't what we expected? How many times do we make decisions based on our impatience because we want things done that very instant. It's not easy to wait, I admit. It's not easy to wait when you're unemployed for a year and God wants something better for you but you want to make decision thinking a particular job would be the best for you. It's not easy to wait when most of your friends are getting married and you haven't even started talking about it yet. So you run around and marry the first guy/girl you meet.

<strong>Ecclesiastes 3:11</strong> says, <em>"He has made everything beautiful in its time."</em> A verse I keep in mind every now a then. Being impatient doesn't just engage us in wrong decisions but throws away God's plan for our lives.

Noah waited a long time for a plan he couldn't see. David waited a long time to be a King even when he thought he was going to be murdered. When God disciplines us, waiting is a part of His plan in our lives. Patience is not just a lesson to learn it is one of the nine fruits of the Spirit. The kind of spirit God wants us to have.

<strong>Psalm 37:7</strong> says, <em>"Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for Him"</em>. Patience is a character quality that God wants us to develop. People say happy endings do not happen in real life. Well, in Christ they do. The Bible ends with a happy ending. Our lives have a higher calling that has infinite happy endings.

Don't compromise on the brand. Jesus is the best quality brand we can every have. Don't settle for anything less than the plan He has for you. God is high quality and therefore, we are high quality.

Just wait and see!
