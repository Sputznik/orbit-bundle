<em>Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say rejoice. (Philippians 4: 4)</em>

This was one of the first verses that I learned.  Maybe it was due to the song, or maybe it was due to its easiness; I do not know. But this verse has helped me a lot of times.

At a point in my life, I often thought how a person can feel and show joy and delight in the toughest situations of life. Lets accept it, our lives are not 100% trouble-free.  In a sense, it may seem even more troublesome than others. Maybe, life might look fallen apart, circumstances may seem dire, and we may not have the perfect life we imagined. Maybe, that has shattered the happiness for a moment in our lives. We do get sad and depressed. And it is completely normal.

That is why, we are called to <em>'rejoice in the Lord'</em>, and not just rejoice in the worldly things.  For the only place where we can find happiness in a world like this, <strong>is in the Lord</strong>.

<strong>Rejoice</strong> in him, in whom we have life.

<strong>Rejoice</strong> because of the life that has been granted to us due to his <strong>unconditional love</strong>.

Trials happen in life for a reason; as God plans to build us, mold us and perfect us.  Be it trouble or happiness, can we have the heart to say, <em>'Yes Lord, I trust in you'</em>? Trusting in him blindly helps us in letting go of our fears and tensions as He turns our mourning into dancing.

I'm valued above all, worth waiting for, and adored beyond measure by God.  Jesus died on the cross for the sake of his love for us.  God’s love for each and every one of His children surpasses all human understandings.  I cannot even fathom that perfect love, let alone, digest that I’m a part of it too.  How can I remain miserable when I know that someone is out there, looking out for every step that I take? Is that not enough for me to remain jubilant at all times?
