Hey all,

Allow me to introduce to you a considered object of a wealthy man in Colossae. Well, the object was more of a person than a thing- a chattel, a man, not to be a man, stripped of name, freedom, choice and life. A machine with pierced ears deprived of all rights. That was his label until he had the divine encounter. And this encounter happened at a jail in Rome where this slave was punished for stealing and eloping from his master. The Agape who did not spare his only son to die on the cross for the redemption of the mankind did not just let him continue in the slavery and bondage. God had assigned his messenger by the name of Paul to reach this broken and shattered man. Thus he was transformed.

Wondering who this man is huh? Well, this is my story, the story of Onesimus- once a slave to Philemon of Colossae, but now a beloved brother to him in Christ. Before, I was a thing who did not even have the right to express my opinions. My life was dictated upon, trampled underfoot like chunk of waste. I felt worthless and dejected each and every second of my life, contemplating on why I was even alive. I had no one to talk to, no one to love me or even treat me like I was loved. Fear surrounded me, I felt caged. But it all changed when I met with Jesus. My encounter with Christ cannot be expressed in words. In Christ, I felt secure, wanted and identified. My chains were gone and I was set free. I became the son of the living God. Above all, for the very first time I felt what God had me to be. My life changed like never before. My God who ransomed me began his good works in me and I became a testimony in many people's life. Paul himself testified about me like this-<i>Philemon 1:11-Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and me.</i>

Many a times we devalue ourselves of who we are. Maybe those around us also do that to us. But it's just the matter of knowing our authority, our identity. As the children of the Creator, we have the power to change things around us. Our lives are more precious and valuable than all that we can compare it with. Once we understand our identity, we will be able to exercise it in our lives too. Shattered and broken, beyond healing and help was my situation. But when God touched me, it all changed. Whatever your situation is, believe that God is over it all.

Onesimus means beneficial or useful.  I was once useless but it was overthrown by God's love and I was made useful. Once rejected, I became accepted; once insecure, I was made secure. For whoever is reading this, I want to tell you something that I learned from my life- When God meets you he wouldn't leave you there. Your life changes like never before.

<i>John 8: 36 - So if the Son sets you free you are free indeed.</i>

Love,
Onesimus
