We all have a set of questions we often ask God. Mostly just one though; "<i>Why me?"  </i>I am a good guy, I have never hurt anyone, the other guy does worse things than I, then why me? Have you ever played the pity card? I played that when I wasn't able to find a job and nothing was making sense to me.
<p dir="ltr">There are so many situations that we don't understand and that takes me to the life of Job, who asked that question. The Bible says he was a righteous man. I believe you get an answer when you ask a question. Job got an answer, but not the one he expected.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We want an explanation of why a particular thing happened. Job asked 'why' and his friends said, “you sinned.” They were finding an explanation for the incident, which is our nature, and it sounds alright to do that. But God’s answer to Job was not an explanation. God started the answer with a question which is typical of God. This is what God said-</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Why do you confuse the issue? Why do you talk without knowing what you’re talking about? Pull yourself together, Job! Up on your feet! Stand tall! I have some questions for you, and I want some straight answers. Where were you when I created the earth? Tell me, since you know so much! Who decided on its size? Certainly you’ll know that! Who came up with the blueprints and measurements? How was its foundation poured, and who set the cornerstone." (Job 38:1-6)</p>
<p dir="ltr">God sarcastically asks Job, “Who decided on its size? Certainly you’ll know that!” I'm sure Job wasn’t expecting that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">God didn’t explain or justify Job's suffering but instead told him about creation. God describes ostrich, horse, and hawk to him! Job was reminded that <i>God, the Creator of the earth, is in control of everything. </i></p>
<p dir="ltr">And the most amazing part of this conversation was that Job was satisfied. Job says, “I’m convinced: You can do anything and everything. Nothing and no one can upset your plans... I admit I once lived by rumours of you; now I have it all firsthand—from my own eyes and ears! I’m sorry—forgive me. I’ll never do that again, I promise! I’ll never again live on crusts of hearsay, crumbs of rumour.” (Job 42: 2-3, 5-6)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some one rightly said, <i><b>“This is God’s universe, he does things his way, you may have a better way, but you don’t have a universe.”</b></i><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">The fact is that God is sovereign. And it’s great, because surrendering to him is the best decision I have made so far. I believe God is just, loving and knows the best for me. Job’s story reminds me that <i>the Creator of all things holds my forever.</i></p>
<p dir="ltr">“There is no greater discovery than seeing God as the author of your destiny.” ―Ravi Zacharias</p>
