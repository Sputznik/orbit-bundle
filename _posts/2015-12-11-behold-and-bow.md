Clear blue sky, above me lies
Dancing like, a dabbling dice
How I wonder, why so blue,
I stare at it, without a clue


Trees so huge, oh so green,
Grown so big, from just a seed
Shade and shelter, it does give,
Under it, whoever lives

 
Crystal clear, I’m mirrored,
By the waters, in the river
Quenches thirst, of every soul,
Life and strength, in them it pours


In awe we stare, at the phenomenal creation
Wondering about, the making of this station  
Still ignore, The hand’s that made
Refuse to give him, the accolade

 
Look at yourself, how beautiful you are
Knit with care, in countless hours
Systematically created, you are for sure
‘coz you were made, with an intention, so pure

 
Behold, your countenance,
You’ll be amazed, in every sense
Bow and praise, the One who is
Owner-Creator, You are His.
