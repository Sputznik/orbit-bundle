<strong>John 3:16</strong>
<em>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.</em>

Cross is the proof of Father God's love for us. Since the fall, man has been hiding from God doubting His goodness and love. Sin corrupts our understanding of the Father. Our Father God was expressing His love at the cross. Love was the only motivation behind the cross.

So when did He begin to love us? Is it when we repented or acknowledged that we were sinners?

<strong>Ephesians 1:4</strong> - <em>For he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world that we may be holy and unblemished in his sight in love.</em>

God loved us before the foundation of the world. That means He knew us before even we were born. Knowing all our weaknesses, faults, unfaithfulness and frailties He didn't give up on us. God our Father knew we were going to go astray and before even we did He forgave us in Christ Jesus whom He foreordained <em>(1 Peter 1:20)</em>. So even before we were lost in Adam He found us in Christ.

Isn't this amazing? God the Father loves us and He cares for us. He is mindful of us <em>(Psalms 8:4)</em>, knows our struggles and empathizes with our weaknesses <em>(Hebrews 4:15)</em>. He is just like the father in the story of the lost son <em>(Luke 15)</em> who forgave his son before he repented and welcomed him back with open arms restoring his sonship.

Cross is not the end of His expression of love. God in the ages to come wants to show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus <em>(Ephesians 2:7)</em>. Can we really comprehend what is the width and length and depth and height of His love <em>(Ephesians 3:18)</em>? Can we experience His love that is beyond knowledge <em>(Ephesians 3:19)</em>? The greatest feeling ever is to be loved. Know for sure that you are loved by Him.
