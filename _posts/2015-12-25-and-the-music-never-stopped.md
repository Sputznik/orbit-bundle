The stars were twinkling on that night, there was darkness all around but in one corner of Bethlehem, the place was well-lit and a baby boy was born. He never looked like a saviour, did he? He was lying in a manger with sounds of all the animals around him and parents who would have probably become the talk of their town.

But the music never stopped. There were angels, three wise men and the shepherds, probably singing and rejoicing for the birth of a king. The music still continues-the carols, the twinkling stars and the best gifts. But aren’t we missing something? Are we? No, it was just a small voice from inside us. Ignore it.

Yeah. The music - it is still ringing in our heads- “Mary’s boy child Jesus Christ was born on Christmas day”…  Oh are the chords correct and the scale?… Is it in sync with the instruments?.. Oh okay..let’s begin….

Are we forgetting that baby who was lying in that manger for whom the music was really for? Or are our eyes still glued to those fancy stars and bells?

Have we ever taken out a minute’s time to just sit and think why Jesus was born? Was it to listen to our melodious songs or to eat the delicious cakes? Oh no! He came for something called ‘love’.

The Holy Bible beautifully describes love:

“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonour others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.  Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.”(I Corinthians 13: 4-8)

Are we able to fit in any one of these words to our relationships that we call as love? But the word that attracts my attention is “perseveres”. The oxford meaning of the word perseveres is to continue in a course of action even in the face of difficulty or with little or no indication of success.

Have we ever persevered for something? Yes, probably worked sleepless nights to get good marks or to perfect a dance move or a chord. Have we ever persevered hard enough for a relationship and that also without any expectations in return?

I know such a person. He persevered for me. First, left his father for me and all his luxuries then lived for 33 years and struggled hard to show me how I have to live here. But his greatest act of perseverance was on the cross where he suffered and died but never left his perseverance for me.

And yes, he was not expecting anything in return but just love. Till today, he is persevering for us.

For me, Christmas is a day when took his perseverance for us to the next step by coming down on Earth. Did he really find what he was looking for? His people?

The music still continues-the carols, the twinkling stars and gifts, but do not forget to keep persevering for him because love is all about that.<a href="http://churchbuzz.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/christmas.jpg">
