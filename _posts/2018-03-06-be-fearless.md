Real Talk! We live in a society where we are constantly bombarded with a notion that if you're not skinny, tall, fair or perfect, you're not going to get anywhere. If you're too skinny, they have a problem, if you put on weight, that's even a bigger problem. Everyone is constantly trying to "fix" you to be something that's pleasant to their eyes. As a teenager, I was skinny! My love for butter and greasy foods never effected my weight (Although the 'Fat' eventually found me in my twenties!) But as I grew older, I came to the realization that people will talk no matter what. It doesn't matter if someone thinks you're too loud or too quiet or too harsh or too soft, what matters is your identity in Christ. You can never go wrong with that!

A few years ago I looked up the meaning of my name. I thought it would be something cool but in reality, the Hebrew meaning of my name means "Bee". I was kinda disappointed. BUT in the Bible, Deborah was a fearless leader and a renowned prophetess, an honored judge, and an ideal role model for every woman called to lead others.

Years ago Deborah convened her court under a palm tree where "the Israelites came to her to have their disputes decided" (Judges 4:5). Undoubtedly their greatest disputes revolved around their oppressors, the Canaanites. Something had to be done, and Deborah was the woman for the job. When she ordered Barak, her secretary of defense, to amass an army, Deborah made it clear who reigned as commander in chief: "The Lord, the God of Israel, commands you" (Judges 4:6). Unlike take-charge Jezebel, who sought no one's counsel, levelheaded Deborah obeyed the Lord and insisted His will—not hers—be done.

The story of Deborah in the Bible inspires me everyday. She did not fear anyone but God. I can imagine back in the day, where women were not given as much consideration, God raised her up to be an example. Not only was she a wise prophetess but she was a songwriter too (Judges 5)

Today, I choose to be the Deborah that God has called me to be. There are many times I fear what people may say or think, or that I am not qualified to do the job, but I know in Christ I am fearless.

Ladies, what is the thing that scares you? What are you afraid of? Is it speaking up about the truth? Or starting something new? Whatever it is, I want to encourage you to BE FEARLESS! because big daddy up in heaven is there to guide you!

P.S- Read Judges 4 &amp; 5 if you need encouragement and inspiration
